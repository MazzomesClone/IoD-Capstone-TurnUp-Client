<h4>This repository contains the TurnUp client</h4>
<p>To use the TurnUp client, you must first setup the backend server by following these instructions:

<p>Once the backend server is setup:</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Clone the respository and <code>cd</code> into the root directory</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Run <code>npm install</code> to install the required dependencies</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>create a .env file in the root directory and add the following values:</p>
<code>VITE_API_URL = http://localhost:3000
 VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY = *YOUR GOOGLE PLACES API KEY*
</code>
</br>
<p><strong>4. </strong>Run <code>npm run dev</code> to run the vite server. Find the URL it has been hosted at in the console and access the client there.</p>
<p><strong>Hooray!</strong> You are ready to use the TurnUp client</p>
